# Content Management & Data Entry Standards
This is my personal checklist for ensuring 100% accuracy when uploading content to WordPress/WooCommerce.

### 1. Product Upload Checklist:
- [ ] SKU verified against inventory sheet.
- [ ] Pricing (Regular & Sale) double-checked.
- [ ] Attributes (Size, Color, Material) mapped correctly.
- [ ] Featured Image set with optimized Alt-text.

### 2. Blog/Article Formatting:
- [ ] Text cleaned of "Word Document" styling artifacts.
- [ ] H1-H3 hierarchy verified for SEO.
- [ ] All external links set to "Open in New Tab".
- [ ] Metadata (Title tag & Meta Description) added.
